# buildfarm_deployment_config

***Deprecation notice***

This branch supports deployment to Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) hosts.
The canonical buildfarm: [build.ros.org](https://build.ros.org) has migrated to Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) with a substantial refactoring of the puppet scripts.

This Trusty branch will no longer receive improvements or bug fixes from Open Robotics but you're welcome to keep using it until you have the opportunity to migrate to Xenial.

This is the repository with the example configurations for the [buildfarm_deployment](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/buildfarm_deployment) implementation.
Please see the documentation in that repository for how to setup a buildfarm.

This is the example configs used for development and deployment on <http://build.ros.org>
